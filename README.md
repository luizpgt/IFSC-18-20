This repository contains old projects from my high school classes.

All README files are written in Portuguese, as the content of these projects is not particularly significant. They are preserved here for historical purposes.

* `api` - Consuming an API.
* `sisGer_Tai` - Rent a car.
* `tai-final` - Internet Forum.
* `talkeasy` - Sign Language Dictionary with blender 3D models.
